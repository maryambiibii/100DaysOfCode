Today, was my day 1 of 100 days of code challenge. I have started to learn python language by following a Udemy course 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022.

I have covered:

Variables in python
,String Manipulation
,Input and Print Functions
- Variable Naming Rules

Choose those name of variables that make our code readable e.g city_name
Variable name can not start with number e.g. city_name not 1city_name
There are certain privileged words that can not use as variable name e.g. input
Space can not be used between words instead use underscore e.g. city_name instead of city name
- Debugging

The terms "bug" and "debugging" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s. While she was working on a Mark II computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were "debugging" the system.

Where, instructor recommended Thonny Python IDE which is designed for beginners. It helps us to better understand how our code works and also in finding the bugs.

- Browser Based Code Editor

Setting up local editors is sometimes time consuming however our aim is to practice coding that we can do by working on browser based code editor, in the start. In this course, instructor chose to work on Replit IDE. Which is free online IDE for Python.

- Project: Band Name Generator

At the end, she assigned us a project that covers all the concepts of Day 1. Where, we have to generate band name for the user by taking the name of their city where they grew up and the name of their pet.
